GIT NOTES:
    *have to pay gitlab to host, should maybe set up rpi server
    *generate and add an ssh key for each new device you want to access the repo
     from using `ssh-keygen`
    *git push origin main
        pushes the most recent commit to branch "main" to the remote repo
    *git pull origin main
        pulls the most recent version of main to the local repo
    edit and commit as per the usual, just don't forget to commit! Have fun!
