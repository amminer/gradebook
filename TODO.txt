[X] Get gitlab repo set up
NOTES:
    *"no free lunch" moment, have to pay gitlab to host, should set up rpi server
    *generate and add an ssh key for each new device you want to access the repo
     from, using `ssh-keygen`
    *git push origin main
        pushes the most recent commit to branch "main" to the remote repo
    *git pull origin main
        pulls the most recent version of main to the local repo
    edit and commit as per the usual, just don't forget to commit! Have fun!
